# Remix: Deploying a Smart Contract

Learn how to deploy a simple Solidity-based smart contract to Uptick using the Remix in-browser IDE

## Pre-requisite Readings

* [Installation](../../concepts/quickstart/installation.md)
* [Run a node](../../concepts/quickstart/run_node.md)
* [MetaMask](../keys-wallets/metamask.md)

[Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/) is an in-browser IDE for [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) smart contracts. In this guide, we will learn how to deploy a contract to a running Uptick network through Remix and interact with it.

## Connect Uptick account to Remix

{% hint style="info" %}
If you havenâ€™t already, follow the steps in the [Metamask guide](../keys-wallets/metamask.md) to import your Uptick private key into Metamask. Start the Uptick daemon and REST server.
{% endhint %}

Go to [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/). There are some contracts in the File Explorer. Replace these with the source code to `Counter.sol` below. On the left-most bar, select the Solidity Compiler and compile the contract.

```javascript
pragma solidity >=0.7.0 <0.9.0;

contract Counter {
  uint256 counter = 0;

  function add() public {
    counter++;
  }

  function subtract() public {
    counter--;
  }

  function getCounter() public view returns (uint256) {
    return counter;
  }
}
```

Next, select the `Deploy and Run` option. Select `Injected Web3` as the `Environment`. This will open a metamask popup for you to connect your Metamask to Remix. Select `Connect` to confirm.

You should see your account show up in the left-hand panel.

## Deploy and Interact

Now that your account is connected, you are able to deploy the contract. Press the `Deploy` button. A metamask pop-up will appear asking you to confirm. Confirm the transaction. You should see a log for the deployment transaction in the Uptick daemon logs:

```bash
I[2020-07-15|17:26:43.155] Added good transaction                       module=mempool tx=877A8E6600FA27EC2B2362719274314977B243671DC4E5F8796ED97FFC0CBE42 res="&{CheckTx:log:"[]" gas_wanted:121193 }" height=31 total=1
```

Once the contract has been successfully deployed, you will see it show up in the `Deployed Contracts` section in the left-hand side, as well as a green check in the Remix console showing the transaction details.

Now, you are able to interact with the contract through Remix. For `Counter.sol`, click `add`. This will open a Metamask pop-up asking you to confirm. Confirm the transaction. Then, click `getCounter` to get the count, which should be `1`.
