# Joining a Testnet

This document outlines the steps to join an existing testnet

## Pick a Testnet

You specify the network you want to join by setting the **genesis file** and **seeds**. If you need more information about past networks, check our [testnets repo](https://github.com/UptickNetwork/uptick-testnet).

| Network Chain ID | Description           | Site                                                                                               | Version                                                                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `origin_1170-1`  | Uptick origin Testnet | [origin\_1170-1 testnet](https://github.com/UptickNetwork/uptick-testnet/tree/main/origin\_1170-1) | [`v0.2.7-gon`](https://github.com/UptickNetwork/uptick/releases/tag/v0.2.7-gon) |

## Public Endpoints

* GRPC: grpc.origin.uptick.network:9090
* RPC: https://rpc.origin.uptick.network
* REST: https://api.origin.uptick.network/
* JSON RPC: https://json-rpc.origin.uptick.network/

## Install `uptickd`

Follow the [installation](https://github.com/starrymedia/upticknetworkdocs/blob/main/quickstart/installation/README.md) document to install the Uptick binary `uptickd`.

warning Make sure you have the right version of `uptickd` installed.

### Save Chain ID

We recommend saving the mainnet `chain-id` into your `uptickd`'s `client.toml`. This will make it so you do not have to manually pass in the `chain-id` flag for every CLI command.

{% hint style="info" %}
See the Official [Chain IDs](../concepts/basics/chain\_id.md#official-chain-ids) for reference.
{% endhint %}

```bash
uptickd config chain-id origin_1170-1
```

## Initialize Node

We need to initialize the node to create all the necessary validator and node configuration files:

```bash
# initialize node configurations
uptickd init <your_custom_moniker> --chain-id origin_1170-1

# download testnel public genesis.json
curl -o $HOME/.uptickd/config/genesis.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UptickNetwork/uptick-testnet/main/origin_1170-1/config/genesis.json


```

## Start testnet

The final step is to [start the nodes](https://github.com/starrymedia/upticknetworkdocs/blob/main/quickstart/run\_node/README.md#start-node). Once enough voting power (+2/3) from the genesis validators is up-and-running, the testnet will start producing blocks.

```bash
uptickd start
```

## Status Sync

To quickly get started, node operators can choose to sync via State Sync. State Sync works by replaying larger chunks of application state directly rather than replaying individual blocks or consensus rounds.

The newest state sync configs can be found [here](https://explorer.origin.uptick.network/uptick%20origin/statesync). Please remember to modify state sync configs.

```bash
# initialize node configurations
uptickd init <moniker> --chain-id origin_1170-1

# download testnel public genesis.json
curl -o $HOME/.uptickd/config/genesis.json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UptickNetwork/uptick-testnet/main/origin_1170-1/config/genesis.json

# Configure State sync
[statesync]
enable = true
rpc_servers = "https://rpc-t.uptick.nodestake.top:443,https://rpc-t.uptick.nodestake.top:443"
trust_height = 0
trust_hash = ""
trust_period = "168h"  # 2/3 of unbonding time

# start the node (you can also use "nohup" or "systemd" to run in the background)
uptickd start
```

## Run a Testnet Validator

Claim your testnet \{{ $themeConfig.project.testnet\_denom \}} on the [faucet](faucet.md) using your validator account address and submit your validator account address:

> NOTE: Until `uptickd status 2>&1 | jq ."SyncInfo"."catching_up"` got false, create your validator. If your validator is jailed, unjail it via `uptickd tx slashing unjail --from <wallet name> --chain-id origin_1170-1 -y -b block`.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more details on how to configure your validator, follow the validator [setup](../guides/validators/setup.md) instructions.
{% endhint %}

```bash
uptickd tx staking create-validator \
  --amount=5000000000000000000auoc \
  --pubkey=$(uptickd tendermint show-validator) \
  --moniker=<$moniker>" \
  --chain-id=origin_1170-1 \
  --commission-rate="0.10" \
  --commission-max-rate="0.20" \
  --commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
  --min-self-delegation="1000000" \
  --gas="auto" \
  --from=<$wallet name> \
  -y \
  -b block
```

## Upgrading Your Node

> NOTE: These instructions are for full nodes that have ran on previous versions of and would like to upgrade to the latest testnet.

### Reset Data

warning If the version \<new\_version> you are upgrading to is not breaking from the previous one, you **should not** reset the data. If this is the case you can skip to [Restart](join.md#restart)

First, remove the outdated files and reset the data.

```bash
rm $HOME/.uptickd/config/addrbook.json $HOME/.uptickd/config/genesis.json
uptickd tendermint unsafe-reset-all
```

Your node is now in a pristine state while keeping the original `priv_validator.json` and `config.toml`. If you had any sentry nodes or full nodes setup before, your node will still try to connect to them, but may fail if they haven't also been upgraded.

{% hint style="info" %}
Warning Make sure that every node has a unique `priv_validator.json`. Do not copy the `priv_validator.json` from an old node to multiple new nodes. Running two nodes with the same `priv_validator.json` will cause you to double sign.
{% endhint %}

### Restart

To restart your node, just type:

```bash
uptickd start
```

### State Syncing a Node

If you want to join the network using State Sync (quick, but not applicable for archive nodes), check our [State Sync](../guides/statesync.md#State-Sync)page
