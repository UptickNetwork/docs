# Create Droplet

Once you've added your SSH key. click on the `'Droplets'` link on the left, and then on the next page click `'Create Droplet'`.

On this page, you'll be presented with a number of options for configuring your DigitalOcean Droplet, including the distribution, the plan, the size/cost per month, region, and authentication. Feel free to choose whichever settings work best for you.

Under `'Authentication'`, select `'SSH Key'`, and select which keys you would like to use (like the one you created in the last step). You can also name your Droplet if you wish. When you're finished, click `'Create Droplet'` at the bottom.

Wait a minute for your Droplet to start up. It'll appear under the `'Droplets'` panel with a green dot next to it when it is up and ready. At this point, we're ready to connect to it.
