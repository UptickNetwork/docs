# Using uptickd

After you have obtained the latest `uptickd` binary, run:

```
uptickd [command]
```

Check the version you are running using

```
uptickd version
```

There is also a `-h`, `--help` command available

```
uptickd -h
```

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also enable auto-completion with the `uptickd completion` command. For example, at the start of a bash session, run `. <(uptickd completion)`, and all `uptickd` subcommands will be auto-completed.
{% endhint %}
