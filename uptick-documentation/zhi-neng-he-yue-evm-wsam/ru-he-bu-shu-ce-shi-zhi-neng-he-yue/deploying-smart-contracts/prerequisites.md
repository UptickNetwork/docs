# PREREQUISITES

You should understand [Ethereum networks](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networks/), [transactions](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/transactions/) and the [anatomy of smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/anatomy/) before deploying smart contracts.  Deploying a contract also costs ether (ETH) since they are stored on the blockchain, so you should be familiar with [gas and fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) on Ethereum.  Finally, you'll need to compile your contract before deploying it, so make sure you've read about [compiling smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/compiling/).
