# What you'll need

* your contract's bytecode – this is generated through [compilation](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/compiling/)
* ETH for gas – you'll set your gas limit like other transactions so be aware that contract deployment needs a lot more gas than a simple ETH transfer
* a deployment script or plugin
* access to an [Ethereum node](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/), either by running your own, connecting to a public node, or via an API key using a [node service](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/)
