# Steps to deploy a smart contract

The specific steps involved will depend on the tooling you use. For an example, check out the [Hardhat documentation on deploying your contracts(opens in a new tab)↗](https://hardhat.org/guides/deploying.html) or [Truffle documentation on networks and app deployment(opens in a new tab)↗](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/advanced/networks-and-app-deployment). These are two of the most popular tools for smart contract deployment, which involve writing a script to handle the deployment steps.

Once deployed, your contract will have an Ethereum address like other [accounts](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/).
