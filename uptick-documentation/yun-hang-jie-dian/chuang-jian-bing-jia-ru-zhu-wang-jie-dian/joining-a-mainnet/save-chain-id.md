# Save Chain ID

We recommend saving the mainnet `chain-id` into your `uptickd`'s `client.toml`. This will make it so you do not have to manually pass in the `chain-id` flag for every CLI command.

{% hint style="info" %}
See the Official [Chain IDs](https://docs.uptick.network/basics/chain\_id.html#official-chain-ids) for reference.
{% endhint %}

```sh
uptickd config chain-id uptick_117-1
```
