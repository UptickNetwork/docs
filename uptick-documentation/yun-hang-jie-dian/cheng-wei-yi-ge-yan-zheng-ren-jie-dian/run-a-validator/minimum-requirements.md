# Minimum Requirements

To run testnet nodes, you will need a machine with the following minimum hardware requirements:

* 4 or more physical CPU cores
* At least 200GB of SSD disk storage
* At least 16GB of memory (RAM)
* At least 50mbps network bandwidth

As the usage of the blockchain grows, the server requirements may increase as well, so you should have a plan for updating your server as well.
