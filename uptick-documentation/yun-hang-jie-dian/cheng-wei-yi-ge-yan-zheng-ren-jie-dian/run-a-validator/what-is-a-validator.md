# What is a Validator?

[Validators](https://docs.uptick.network/guides/validators/overview.html) are responsible for committing new blocks to the blockchain through voting. A validator's stake is slashed if they become unavailable or sign blocks at the same height. Please read about [Sentry Node Architecture](https://docs.uptick.network/guides/validators/validator-faq.html#how-can-validators-protect-themselves-from-denial-of-service-attacks) to protect your node from DDoS attacks and to ensure high-availability.
