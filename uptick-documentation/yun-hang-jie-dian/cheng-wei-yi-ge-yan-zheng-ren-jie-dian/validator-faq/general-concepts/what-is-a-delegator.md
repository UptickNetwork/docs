# What is a delegator?

Delegators are UPTICK holders who cannot, or do not want to run validator operations themselves. Users can delegate UPTICK to a validator and obtain a part of its revenue in exchange (for more detail on how revenue is distributed, see [What is the incentive to stake?](https://docs.uptick.network/guides/validators/faq.html#what-is-the-incentive-to-stake) and [What is a validator's commission?](https://docs.uptick.network/guides/validators/faq.html#what-is-a-validators-commission) sections below).Because they share revenue with their validators, delegators also share responsibility. Should a validator misbehave, each of its delegators will be partially slashed in proportion to their stake. This is why delegators should perform due-diligence on validators before delegating, as well as diversifying by spreading their stake over multiple validators.Delegators play a critical role in the system, as they are responsible for choosing validators. Be aware that being a delegator is not a passive role. Delegators are obligated to remain vigilant and actively monitor the actions of their validators, switching should they fail to act responsibly.
