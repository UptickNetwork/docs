# What are bandwidth requirements?

Uptick has the capacity for very high throughput compared to chains like Ethereum or Bitcoin.

As such, we recommend that the data center nodes only connect to trusted full nodes in the cloud or other validators that know each other socially. This relieves the data center node from the burden of mitigating denial-of-service attacks.

Ultimately, as the network becomes more used, one can realistically expect daily bandwidth on the order of several gigabytes.
