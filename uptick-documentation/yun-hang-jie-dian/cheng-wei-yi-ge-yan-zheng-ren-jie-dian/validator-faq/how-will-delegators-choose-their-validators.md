# How will delegators choose their validators?

Delegators are free to choose validators according to their own subjective criteria. That said, criteria anticipated to be important include:

* Amount of self-bonded UPTICK: Number of UPTICK a validator self-bonded to its staking pool. A validator with higher amount of self-bonded UPTICK has more skin in the game, making it more liable for its actions.
* Amount of delegated UPTICK: Total number of UPTICK delegated to a validator. A high stake shows that the community trusts this validator, but it also means that this validator is a bigger target for hackers. Validators are expected to become less and less attractive as their amount of delegated UPTICK grows. Bigger validators also increase the centralization of the network.
* Commission rate: Commission applied on revenue by validators before it is distributed to their delegators
* Track record: Delegators will likely look at the track record of the validators they plan to delegate to. This includes seniority, past votes on proposals, historical average uptime and how often the node was compromised.

Apart from these criteria, there will be a possibility for validators to signal a website address to complete their resume. Validators will need to build reputation one way or another to attract delegators. For example, it would be a good practice for validators to have their setup audited by third parties. Note though, that the Uptick team will not approve or conduct any audit itself.
