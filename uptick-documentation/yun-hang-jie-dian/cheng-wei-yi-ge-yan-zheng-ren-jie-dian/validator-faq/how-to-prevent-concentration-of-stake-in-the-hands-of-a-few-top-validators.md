# How to prevent concentration of stake in the hands of a few top validators?

For now the community is expected to behave in a smart and self-preserving way. When a mining pool in Bitcoin gets too much mining power the community usually stops contributing to that pool. Uptick will rely on the same effect initially. In the future, other mechanisms will be deployed to smoothen this process as much as possible:

* **Penalty-free re-delegation:** This is to allow delegators to easily switch from one validator to another, in order to reduce validator stickiness.
* **UI warning:** Wallets can implement warnings that will be displayed to users if they want to delegate to a validator that already has a significant amount of staking power.
