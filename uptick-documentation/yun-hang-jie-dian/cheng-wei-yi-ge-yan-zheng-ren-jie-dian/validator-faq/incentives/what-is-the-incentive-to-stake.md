# What is the incentive to stake?

Each member of a validator's staking pool earns different types of revenue:

* Block rewards: Native tokens of applications run by validators (e.g. UPTICK on Uptick) are inflated to produce block provisions. These provisions exist to incentivize UPTICK holders to bond their stake, as non-bonded UPTICK will be diluted over time.
* Transaction fees: Uptick maintains a whitelist of token that are accepted as fee payment. The initial fee token is the `uptick`.

This total revenue is divided among validators' staking pools according to each validator's weight. Then, within each validator's staking pool the revenue is divided among delegators in proportion to each delegator's stake. A commission on delegators' revenue is applied by the validator before it is distributed.
