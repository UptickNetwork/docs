# What are the different types of keys?

In short, there are two types of keys:

* Tendermint Key: This is a unique key used to sign block hashes. It is associated with a public key `uptickvalconspub`.
  * Generated when the node is created with `uptickd init`.
  * Get this value with `uptickd tendermint show-validator`
* e.g. `uptickvalconspub1zcjduc3qcyj09qc03elte23zwshdx92jm6ce88fgc90rtqhjx8v0608qh5ssp0w94c`
* Application keys: These keys are created from the application and used to sign transactions. As a validator, you will probably use one key to sign staking-related transactions, and another key to sign oracle-related transactions. Application keys are associated with a public key `uptickpub-` and an address `uptick-`. Both are derived from account keys generated by `uptickd keys add`.

A validator's operator key is directly tied to an application key, but uses reserved prefixes solely for this purpose: `uptickvaloper` and `uptickvaloperpub`
