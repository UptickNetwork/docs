# What are the responsiblities of a validator?

Validators have three main responsibilities:

* Be able to constantly run a correct version of the software: validators need to make sure that their servers are always online and their private keys are not compromised.
* Provide oversight and feedback on correct deployment of community pool funds: the Uptick protocol includes the a governance system for proposals to the facilitate adoption of its currencies. Validators are expected to hold budget executors to account to provide transparency and efficient use of funds.

Additionally, validators are expected to be active members of the community. They should always be up-to-date with the current state of the ecosystem so that they can easily adapt to any change.
