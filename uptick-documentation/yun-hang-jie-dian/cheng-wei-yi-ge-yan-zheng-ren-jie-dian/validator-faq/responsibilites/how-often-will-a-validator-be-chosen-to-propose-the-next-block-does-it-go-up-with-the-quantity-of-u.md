# How often will a validator be chosen to propose the next block? Does it go up with the quantity of U

The validator that is selected to mine the next block is called the proposer, the "leader" in the consensus for the round. Each proposer is selected deterministically, and the frequency of being chosen is equal to the relative total stake (where total stake = self-bonded stake + delegators stake) of the validator. For example, if the total bonded stake across all validators is 100 UPTICK, and a validator's total stake is 10 UPTICK, then this validator will be chosen 10% of the time as the proposer.To understand more about the proposer selection process in Tendermint BFT consensus, read more [in their official docs](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/spec/reactors/consensus/proposer-selection.html).
