# Key Management - HSM

It is mission critical that an attacker cannot steal a validator's key. If this is possible, it puts the entire stake delegated to the compromised validator at risk. Hardware security modules are an important strategy for mitigating this risk.HSM modules must support `ed25519` signatures for the hub. The [YubiHSM2 supports `ed25519` and can be used with this yubikey [library (opens new window)](https://github.com/iqlusioninc/yubihsm.rs). The YubiHSM can protect a private key but cannot ensure in a secure setting that it won't sign the same block twice.The Tendermint team is also working on extending our Ledger Nano S application to support validator signing. This app can store recent blocks and mitigate double signing attacks.We will update this page when more key storage solutions become available.
