# Upgrade Node

We highly recommend validators use Cosmovisor to run their nodes. This will make low-downtime upgrades smoother, as validators don't have to manually upgrade binaries during the upgrade. Instead users can preinstall new binaries, and cosmovisor will automatically update them based on on-chain Software Upgrade proposals.

You should review the docs for Cosmovisor located [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/run-node/cosmovisor.html)

If you choose to use Cosmovisor, please continue with these instructions. If you choose to upgrade your node manually instead, skip to the [the instructions without Cosmovisor](https://docs.uptick.network/guides/upgrades/upgrade\_node.html#upgrade-manually)
