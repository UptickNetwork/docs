# Deploy Smart Contract with Remix

You need to deploy your smart contract for it to be available to users of an Ethereum network.

[Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/) is an in-browser IDE for Solidity smart contracts. In this guide, we will learn how to deploy a contract to a running Ethermint network through Remix and interact with it.


## [Add Network with Metamask](../started/README.md#Connect to Testnet)

Before we use Remix to develop and deploy smart contracts, we could first add a custom network for IRISHub with [Metamask](https://metamask.io/).

Open the Metamask extension on your browser, you may have to log in to your Metamask account if you are not already.

## Connect IRIShub account to Remix

Go to [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/),select the Deploy and run transaction. Note you should change the environment to Injected Provider. This will open a Metamask popup for you to confirm connecting your Metamask to Remix.
