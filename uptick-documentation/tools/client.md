# Client Integrations

Client integration libraries play a crucial role in blockchain technology by making it easier for developers to interact with the blockchain network. Libraries abstract away complexities and provide integrations and methods to allow developers to create product in a more consistent manner.

## Ethereum Client Integrations

EthersJS and Web3JS are two most commonly used libraries in dApp development. Developer uses these libraries to interact with blockchain and query JSON-RPC data, for example. Additionally, both of these libraries contain utilities to aid in task like converting large numbers (BigNumber).

  * [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/) is the latest JS library that aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.
  * [web3js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.10.0/) is a collection of libraries that allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or WebSocket.
