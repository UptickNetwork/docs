# Changing RPC/REST on Keplr Wallet

There are times when the wallet's connected RPC or REST is not working and requires an update. Check the [networks list](https://docs.evmos.org/develop/api/networks) for endpoints to use. To change the configuration, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Keplr Wallet Extension
2. Go to `Settings` and go to `Endpoints`
3. Make sure you are on the `Uptick Testnet` network from the dropdown. Testnet networks will likely be towards the bottom of the list.
4. Update either the `RPC` or `Rest` or both inputs and click `Confirm`
