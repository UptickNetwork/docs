# Importing Accounts

If you own the private key to an account, you can import it to Metamask to use the account on Uptick. Go to `My Accounts` (top right circle) and select `Import Account`. You should see an image like the following one:

TIP

If it takes some time to load the balance of the account, change the network to `Main Ethereum Network` (or any other than `Localhost 8545` or

Uptick) and then switch back to Uptick.
{% endhint %}
