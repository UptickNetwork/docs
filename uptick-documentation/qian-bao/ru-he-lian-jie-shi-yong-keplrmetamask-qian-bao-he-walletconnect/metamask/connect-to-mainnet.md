# Connect to Mainnet

If you don't have MetaMask installed, go to the [MetaMask website](https://metamask.io/download/) and install the extension for your browser. Once installed, click the link below to connect your Metamask wallet with Uptick Mainnet using Chainlist.

Chainlist helps you connect to the Uptick. It provides an overview of RPC nodes that you can connect to. The purpose of RPC nodes is to allow applications and users to communicate with a Blockchain network. RPC nodes listen for requests, respond with the necessary data, or execute the requested transaction.

Click `Add to Metamask` to connect to the standard provider or choose from a list of RPC Server providers by clicking `Connect Wallet` next to the address.
