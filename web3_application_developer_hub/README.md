# Introduction

Uptick Network has built an open infrastructure and welcomes developers to collaborate and create NFT based ecosystems.

This document will introduce how dApp developers can quickly and easily create their own dApp on Uptick network using web3 and ethers.

Based on the high real-time performance, high concurrency, high security level, high data throughput, and low gas fees of Uptick Network, here are some potential NFT ecosystem application scenarios:

**Collectibles:** You can use Uptick Network to create NFTs that represent unique digital items or collectibles, such as artworks, trading cards, or virtual in-game items. These NFTs focus on uniqueness and scarcity and can be collected and traded by users.

**Functionality:** Functionality NFTs can provide specific features or utilities in platforms or applications, such as membership and loyalty, coupons and vouchers, tickets, content access rights, voting rights, or in-game assets that enhance gameplay. Uptick Network can support the creation and management of these functionality NFTs.

**Social:** Social NFTs are associated with social interactions and participation. You can use Uptick Network to create badges or rewards that recognize users' achievements and participation in online communities, events, or platforms. These NFTs can enhance social interactions and encourage active participation.

**Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocol:** NFTs, as unique digital assets, can be integrated with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and other financial infrastructures. With the support of Uptick Network, you can use NFTs to enhance liquidity, achieve higher returns, and interact with other financial applications and protocols.

Uptick Network provides infrastructure protocol layer services with different features based on various business scenarios to meet the needs of different applications. This will provide rich possibilities for creating a diverse NFT ecosystem.
