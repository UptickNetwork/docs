# Browser Extension

Interacting with a web3 wallet is typical for all websites that want to communicate with a blockchain. A web3 wallet is an application that allows users to send and receive funds and execute actions like swapping tokens in decentralized exchanges or buying NFTs on various marketplaces. Many wallets exist for different platforms (mobile/desktop/browser extension). Most browser extension wallets support EVM-compatible blockchains .

Uptick Network integrates an **EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)** module support, enabling compatibility with a wide variety of smart contracts and dApps.So most browser extensions can support Uptick Network.

There are many browser extension wallets in the digital currency market, such as MetaMask、Coinbase Wallet、GameStop Wallet、Rabby、MathWallet、Brave、Opera、Wallet Connect、Portis、Frame, among which MetaMask is the most commonly used.

The [MetaMask Ethereum provider API](https://docs.metamask.io/wallet/reference/provider-api/) is a JavaScript API that MetaMask injects into websites visited by MetaMask users. Your dapp can use this API to request users' Ethereum accounts, read data from blockchains the user is connected to, and suggest that the user sign messages and transactions.
