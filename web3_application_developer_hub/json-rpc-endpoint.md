# JSON-RPC Endpoint

Uptick supports most of the standard web3 [JSON-RPC APIs](https://docs.uptick.network/api/json-rpc/running\_server) to connect with existing web3 tooling.

JSON-RPC endpoints refers to the network location where a program could transfer its RPC requests to access server data. Once you connect a decentralized application to an RPC endpoint, you can access the functionalities of different operations, which could enable real-time usage of blockchain data. Uptick network Chain provides several RPC endpoints for connectinto both its Minent and Testnet. In this section, we list the JSON-RPC endpoints that can be used for connecting to Uptick network Chain.
