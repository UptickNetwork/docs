# Use  SDK

It is often used to create decentralized applications (dapps), wallets (such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [Tally](https://tallyho.org/)) and other tools and simple scripts that require reading and writing to the blockchain.

You can use any SDK supported by Ethereum, such as [web3.js](../browser-extension/)[ ](https://github.com/web3/web3.js)or [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js)

[Web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js) is a TypeScript implementation of the [Ethereum JSON RPC API](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API) and related tooling maintained by [ChainSafe Systems](https://chainsafe.io).

The [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js) library aims to be a complete and compact library for interacting with the Ethereum Blockchain and its ecosystem.
