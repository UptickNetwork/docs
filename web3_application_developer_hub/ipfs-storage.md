# IPFS Storage

Uptick Network's storage module supports IPFS storage, which is a commonly used distributed storage solution in the blockchain and NFT domains. This integration allows for decentralized file storage and access, improving security, persistence, and efficiency in blockchain applications. Uptick Network recommends IPFS as the best solution for this purpose.

The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a set of composable, peer-to-peer protocols for addressing, routing, and transferring [content-addressed](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/glossary/#content-addressing) data in a decentralized file system. Many popular Web3 projects are built on IPFS - see the [ecosystem directory](https://ecosystem.ipfs.tech)
